				<img src="assets/image/xgboost.webp" class='featured-image' alt="xgboost">
				<p>
					Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide. Alzheimerâ€™s disease and Parkinsonâ€™s disease
					are the most common neurodegenerative diseases. In 2016, an estimated 5.4 million Americans were living with
					Alzheimerâ€™s disease. An estimated 930,000 people in the United States could be living with Parkinsonâ€™s disease
					by 2020.
				</p>
				<p>
					The goal of this project is to build a model to accurately predict the presence of a neurodegenerative
					disease in an individual as early detection of a neurodegenerative disease could be useful for the
					identification of people who can participate in trials of neuroprotective agents, or ultimately to try and
					halt disease progression once effective disease-modifying interventions have been identified.

				<img src="assets/image/corona.jpeg" class='featured-image' alt="eda">
				<p>Coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19, has caused coronavirus pandemic in 2019-2020. It's spread
					around the world very quickly.
					In this blog post, we will discover the spread of COVID-19 cases in the USA States. The data that we used in
					this task is the Covid-19 USA States from Kaggle. This data is about cases around the US States from 22
					January until 26 April 2020.
				</p>
				<p>From this exploratory, we hope that we can answer some questions, such as:
					<ol>
						<li>Where does the first case happen?</li>
						<li>Which states have the most corona cases?</li>
						<li>How is the growth of the corona case to date?</li>
						<li>Is there any state that has zero cases?</li>
					</ol>

				<img src="assets/image/trans.png" class='featured-image' alt="clustering">
				<p>Banda Aceh is capital city from Aceh Province, Indonesia. Placed in the north most of Sumatra Island. It not
					only acts as capital government but also center of economic, political, social and cultural activities. It is
					also the oldest Islamic city in Southeast Asia, where Banda Aceh was the capital city of the Sultanate of
					Aceh.</p>
				<p>Like many city buses in general, Trans Koetaradja serves people transportation around the city. So far, there
					are four corridors around the Banda Aceh. People and tourists in Banda Aceh can easily travel around the city
					using these busses. The fun fact is, from the operating year, 2016 up to 2019, we can use it at no cost. But
					not again this year.</p>
				<p>There are many Trans Koetaradja bus stops around the city. So, these buses roam around the city all day with
					different kinds of people. From school students, workers, merchants until old people that must go to the
					hospital. We never know where people will go from a certain stop. So, in this project, we will map the main
					usage of those bus stops.</p>
